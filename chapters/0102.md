# Why animate?

> "Animation is about creating the illusion of life."

Before we get into the technical side of CSS animation, let's discuss **why** we're animating in the first place.

## More than words alone

Animation can convey information efficiently, or it can be used to grab attention but in the end it's all about communication.

Movement in our designs gives us a more powerful way to communicate. It transcends verbal and written language.

Subtle and appropriate animation can add appeal to our designs and credibility to our work. This happens because as humans we're used to seeing movement all the time in the "real" world. Bringing some of that life into our work brings the two closer.

As our web browsers continue to improve and better support animation, it's becoming a more viable option than ever. In many ways animation is as important to web design as the fonts we use and layouts we create.

## What is animation on the web?

Animation brings us two main benefits: conveying information and grabbing attention. We can come up with many ways these benefits can help us as we build for the web.

Animation can be subtle, like when the CodePen save button wiggles a little to remind us when we need to save our work:

![Animated "Save" button (http://codepen.io/donovanh/pen/KwEQdQ)](images/save_button-min.gif)

We're very good at spotting movement. It's something we've evolved to do. Adding a little animation here and there can introduce some of that "illusion of life" in a very subtle way.

We can also use animation to introduce content to a page:

![Animating list items (https://cssanimation.rocks/list-items/)](images/list_item-min.gif)

By animating information onto the page, we give our viewers an extra piece of information that might otherwise be missing. The animation both draws attention to the new content being added and gives context to that new information. Without animation it would just suddenly appear, possibly leaving the viewer unsure of whether it was there all along.

We can use animation to tell a story:

![Portal animation (http://hop.ie/portal/)](images/portal-min.gif)

The above is based on an instructional video for the game "Portal". However, telling stories through our content doesn't always need to be so literal. We can add subtle movement to show how data changes in a chart, like this example from [Sprout](http://sprout.is):

## With great power comes great responsibility

It's easy to do too much with animation. Having too many things moving around on the page at once is distracting. It's usually a good idea to try to do _less_ animation when possible. Any movement you do add will be all the more powerful.

This might mean only moving a small item on your page. Sometimes it's ok to do _less_.

Having said that, if you want to create more of a "wow" effect with larger animations, you can do so. If you do, make sure and stop when it's time for your viewers to focus on the content. This example from Rally does just that, with lots of movement going on that stops when it's time to read the menu content:

## Inspiration

Animation has a long and rich history. I recently wrote a post on [Principles of Animation for the Web](https://cssanimation.rocks/principles/). The principles draw from Disney's 1981 book [The Illusion of Life: Disney Animation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_basic_principles_of_animation).

If you want to go further, dig into the [Animator's Survival Kit videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loCiTO8qEMI). YouTube is full of sources of inspiration and ideas.

For loads of great examples, take some time to browse [Hover States](http://hoverstat.es/). This site features all sorts of interesting examples of animation from the web. [Dribbble.com](https://dribbble.com/) is helpful also.

For example, here's a nice example from Dribbble showing [Google's Material Design principles](https://dribbble.com/shots/1621920-Google-Material-Design-Free-AE-Project-File). Searching for "animation" is a great way to find inspiring ideas.

I also regularly check up on what's happening at [CodePen](https://codepen.io). It's a great source of canvas and web animation examples.

## Summary

* Animation is kind of a big deal
* Used right, it can be a useful and powerful tool in our designs
* Use it to grab attention or convey information
* Don't overdo it
* If you want to stand out, animation can really help

## Homework

Think about your own work and how animation might help.

It's tempting to go crazy and animate all the things, but try to look for ways subtle animation might better _help_ your visitors understand the content. Is there a call-to-action on your page people are missing? Is there a sudden change in your page that's happening too suddenly, and could benefit from a smoother transition?

Lastly, take a look at sites like <a href="http://hoverstat.es/">Hover States</a> and <a href="http://littlebigdetails.com/">Little Big Details</a> and <a href="https://dribbble.com/">Dribbble</a>. These sorts of sites help if you're ever stuck for ideas.
