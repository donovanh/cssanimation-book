# Storytelling

Now that we've covered both the `transition` and `animation` property, let's combine both into an animation with a hover effect.

## Heroes

Many sites like to make use of a large, attention-grabbing image at the top of their homepage. Sometimes called a "hero image", this is usually a full-width banner style element.

A nice example I found recently was the [Fabric](https://get.fabric.io) landing page. A CSS animatiom shows how Fabric works as a modular framework.

<div class="example">
  <img src="images/fabric-min.gif" style="max-width: 200px; margin: 24px auto 0; display: block;">
  <p class="source"><a href="https://get.fabric.io/">Source</a></p>
</div>

Another interesting example is the [Mailchimp homepage](http://mailchimp.com). Here the hero image tells a story by demonstrating how emails are created.

<div class="example">
  <img src="images/mailchimp-min.gif" style="max-width: 200px; margin: 24px auto 0; display: block;">
  <p class="source"><a href="http://mailchimp.com">Source</a></p>
</div>

You may have also seen it in action on this course's landing page:

<div class="example">
  <img src="images/course-min.gif" style="max-width: 200px; margin: 24px auto 0; display: block;">
  <p class="source"><a href="https://cssanimation.rocks/courses/animation-101/">Source</a></p>
</div>

In each of these examples, they use animation to set the tone of the page and illustrate what the site is about. 

## Example: Scrolling background

Let's create an example of our own. In this example I've created a "web page" style graphic that moves up and down the screen. 

<div class="example">
  <img src="images/screen-min.gif" style="max-width: 400px; margin: 24px auto 0; display: block;">
  <p class="source"><a href="http://codepen.io/donovanh/pen/LEwedW?editors=110">Source</a></p>
</div>

For a bit of interactivity, the animation pauses and a message is shown when a mouse cursor hovers over the screen. It makes use of both animations and transitions to achieve this effect.

[See it in action here](http://codepen.io/donovanh/pen/LEwedW?editors=110).

## Part 1: Background animation

To set up this example we begin with the HTML element to contain it:

    <div class="screen"></div>


We can make the "screen" div look like a monitor or iPad using some styles:

    .screen {
      background: #e25865 url(//cssanimation.rocks/screen/images/screen_bg.png) no-repeat top center;
      background-size: 100% auto;
      border: 2em solid #fff;
      border-radius: 1em;
      width: 40em;
      height: 30em;
    }

We have some styles here defining the size and border, and [setting a background image](https://cssanimation.rocks/screen/images/screen_bg.png).

The effect we're creating is based on moving a background image. The background image is taller than the screen and has a `background-size` of `100% auto`. This means the background will fit the width of our container but be taller.

With a background image to animate, we can now write the `keyframes` that make it look like someone is scrolling a web page:

    @keyframes scroll {
      0%, 10% {
        background-position: 0 0;
      }
      20%, 30% {
        background-position: 0 -22em;
      }
      50%, 60% {
        background-position: 0 -44em;
      }
      90%, 100% {
        background-position: 0 0;
      }
    }

The property we're animating is `background-position`. With this property we can move it up and down. It begins at `0 0`, which means zero distance from the left, and zero from the top. 

In the next frames we have the background move 22 ems up, then 44 ems up, then return to the top of the page. Let's create an animation property to apply this to the "screen" element.

    .screen {
      animation: scroll 5s infinite cubic-bezier(.52,-0.39,.3,1.43);
    }

This CSS is applying the a set of keyframes called "scroll", telling it to take 5 seconds, run forever and use a `cubic-bezier` timing function. In this case the cubic bezier function gives the animation the bounciness as without it the movement would look less lifelike.

I generated this bezier over on [cubic-bezier.com](http://cubic-bezier.com/#.52,-0.39,.3,1.43). If you haven't bookmarked that site yet, I'd absolutely recommend you do!

## Part 2: Adding the hover transition

It's a good idea to pause or stop an animation once it's finished or when you want people to concentrate on something else. Constant animation can be distracting, so let's make use of `animation-play-state` to pause the animation when on hover.

    .screen:hover {
      animation-play-state: paused;
    }

This means that when a cursor hovers over the animation, it will pause. And when the cursor moves away again, it will resume its default `playing` state.

You can achieve this with JavaScript also. One possibility is to have some JavaScript disable the animation when the user interacts with another part of the page, or perhaps when they scroll away. We'll take a look at how to enable animations on scroll later.

### Adding a message

We can also go further and have a message transition into place when a user hovers over the element. To do this we'll need a little more HTML:

    <div class="screen">
      <div class="message">Hover message!</div>
    </div>

In [the CodePen CSS](http://codepen.io/donovanh/pen/LEwedW?editors=110) we position this message in the middle of the "screen" and make it invisible.

    .message {
      /*... positioning styles ...*/
      opacity: 0;
      transition: all 0.4s ease-out;
    }


We can then show it on hover using a `transition`:

    .screen:hover .message {
      opacity: 1;
    } 

Since we set a `transition` on the "message" styling, it creates the animation both when the cursor hovers over the element and when it leaves. The paused animation and transition effects look like this:

<div class="example">
  <img src="images/screen-hover-min.gif" style="max-width: 400px; margin: 24px auto 0; display: block;">
  <p class="source"><a href="http://codepen.io/donovanh/pen/LEwedW?editors=110">Source</a></p>
</div>

## Summary

Today we combined both an animation and a transition to create an effect that could be useful for landing pages and product tours. We made use of the `animation-play-state` to make sure the animation stopped when we wanted it to.

  <h2>Homework</h2>
  <p>Take a moment to think about what we've covered so far.</p>
  <p>We covered a lot. Combining animations and transitions is a powerful way to bring pages to life.</p>
  <p>When thinking about how this can apply to your work, think about how it might be controlled too. When might animation work for your users' benefit, and when might it work against it? It's great to know how to animate but even better to know when not to.</p>

**Tomorrow:** We're going to take a look at combining keyframe animations with 3D transforms to create a cinematic effect.
